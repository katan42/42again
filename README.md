# 🏛️ 42 Projects

Welcome to my personal archive of projects completed at [42 Singapore](https://42singapore.sg), where I'm building a solid foundation in low-level programming, algorithm design, and system architecture using C.

## 🧠 Key Skills Gained
- Manual memory management (malloc, free)
- Recursive logic and backtracking
- Pointer manipulation and double pointers
- Writing reusable, modular code under strict constraints
- Debugging with Valgrind, GDB, and careful testing

## 🚧 Ongoing Work

I'm continuing to polish key projects and exploring new ones as part of the Core Curriculum, including:
- `Philophers` – Classic concurrency problem exploring threads, mutexes, race conditions & timing constraints. Focus on designing deterministic behaviour and avoiding deadlocks.
